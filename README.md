# Spring Microservices in Action

An introduction to microservices with Java and Spring, by John Carnell and Illary Huaylupo Sánchez, from the classic Manning series "... in Action".

# Some notes

I didn't really like this book. It is very well written and explained on the theory side, but fails on the "in action" side. First, the application developed through the book has pretty much any functionality, beyond a simple CRUD, so we add and add more microservices patterns without major changes or advantages, which makes it all very artificial. Second, it's not easy to code together, sometimes things change from chapter to chapter, with nothing being said. So you have a bug related to something that is no longer there. To make matters worse, the official GitHub repository is also not very organized, with leaked/forgotten code between chapters.
